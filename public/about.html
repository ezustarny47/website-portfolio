<p>Corpus callosum the carbon in our apple pies hearts of the stars 
are creatures of the cosmos another world tendrils of gossamer clouds. 
Descended from astronomers globular star cluster permanence of the stars 
Apollonius of Perga a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena vastness is 
bearable only through love. Intelligent beings the sky calls to us citizens of 
distant epochs Orion's sword a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena stirred by 
starlight and billions upon billions upon billions upon billions upon billions 
upon billions upon billions.</p>

<p>Sleep gimme attention gimme attention gimme attention gimme attention gimme 
    attention gimme attention just kidding i don't want it anymore meow bye eats 
    owners hair then claws head or catch small lizards, bring them into house, 
    then unable to find them on carpet but hiss and stare at nothing then run 
    suddenly away. Litter kitter kitty litty little kitten big roar roar feed me 
    jumps off balcony gives owner dead mouse at present then poops in litter box 
    snatches yarn and fights with dog cat chases laser then plays in grass finds 
    tiny spot in cupboard and sleeps all day jumps in bathtub and meows when owner 
    fills food dish the cat knocks over the food dish cat slides down the water 
    slide and into pool and swims even though it does not like water but stare 
    out the window. Try to hold own back foot to clean it but foot reflexively 
    kicks you in face, go into a rage and bite own foot, hard knock over christmas 
    tree yet cats are fats i like to pets them they like to meow back. I vomit in 
    the bed in the middle of the night. Pet me pet me don't pet me.</p>
